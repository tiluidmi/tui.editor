## Best Skill Build for Gladiators
 
The skill build for Gladiators depends on your personal preference and playstyle, but there are some general guidelines that you can follow. Here are the main points to consider when choosing your skills:
 
- Focus on skills that deal area of effect (AoE) damage, such as Whirlwind, Hurricane Slash, and Blade Force. These skills will help you clear mobs faster and deal more damage to multiple enemies in the arena.
- Invest in skills that boost your attack speed, such as Dash and Fatal Impact. These skills will help you chain your combos faster and increase your DPS.
- Learn skills that enhance your survivability, such as Bloodlust, Iron Skin, and Parry. These skills will help you heal yourself, reduce incoming damage, and block enemy attacks.
- Balance your skill points between the Sword and Magic skill trees. The Sword skill tree has more offensive skills, while the Magic skill tree has more defensive and utility skills. You can also mix and match skills from both trees to create your own hybrid build.
