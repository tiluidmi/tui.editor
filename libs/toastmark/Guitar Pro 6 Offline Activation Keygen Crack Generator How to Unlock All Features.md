## What Causes the Steam Offline Error and White Screen Problem?
 
The steam offline error occurs when the game tries to connect to the Steam servers but fails due to various reasons, such as firewall settings, network issues, or corrupted files. The white screen problem happens when the game fails to load properly due to incompatible settings, such as time zone, resolution, or compatibility mode. These problems can prevent you from playing the game or cause crashes and freezes.
 
## How to Fix the Steam Offline Error and White Screen Problem?
 
There are several possible solutions for these problems, depending on your situation. Here are some of the most common ones:
 
- **Rename the game folder**: Some players have reported that renaming the game folder to something shorter and simpler, such as "MGS" or "Metal Gear Solid V", can fix the steam offline error. This is because the game does not support long folder names and may cause conflicts with Steam. To rename the game folder, go to your game directory and right-click on it, then select Rename and enter a new name.
- **Edit the 3DMGAME.ini file**: Another possible solution for the steam offline error is to edit the 3DMGAME.ini file, which is located in your game directory. This file contains some settings that affect how the game runs. To edit it, open it with a text editor such as Notepad and look for a line that says BLoggedOn=false. Change it to BLoggedOn=true and save the file. This should get rid of the error message.
- **Change your time zone**: One of the most common causes of the white screen problem is having a different time zone than UTC +8:00, which is the time zone of Beijing, Hong Kong, etc. This can cause some issues with the game loading and rendering. To fix this, you need to change your time zone to UTC +8:00. To do this, click on the date and time in the bottom right of your desktop and select Date and time settings. Then select UTC +8:00 from the drop-down menu or manually adjust your time zone accordingly.
- **Turn off compatibility mode**: Compatibility mode is a feature that allows you to run older programs on newer versions of Windows. However, sometimes it can cause problems with newer games, such as Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. To turn off compatibility mode, right-click on the game's executable file (mgsvtpp.exe) in your game directory and select Properties. Then go to the Compatibility tab and uncheck the box that says Run this program in compatibility mode for. Click OK and try running the game again.
- **Run the game as an administrator**: Running the game as an administrator can give it more permissions and access to system resources, which can help with some issues. To run the game as an administrator, right-click on the game's executable file (mgsvtpp.exe) in your game directory and select Run as administrator. You may need to enter your password or confirm your action if prompted.

## How to Play Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain With a Crack?
 
If you want to play Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain without buying it from Steam or using a legit copy, you will need a crack. A crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses its protection mechanisms, such as Steam or Denuvo. However, using a crack is illegal and may expose you to malware or viruses, so we do not recommend it.
 
If you still want to use a crack, you will need to download it from a reliable source, such as CODEX or CPY. These are groups of hackers who release cracks for various games. You will also need to download
