The game was played in 1975, when Zavanelli and Palciauskas were both young and ambitious chess players. They met in the US Open Chess Championship in Lincoln, Nebraska, where they faced each other in the fifth round. Zavanelli had already won the US Junior Championship in 1973 and 1974, while Palciauskas had won the World Correspondence Chess Championship in 1978.
  
The game started with the e4 opening, followed by e5 from black. Zavanelli then played d4, initiating the Scotch Game. Palciauskas responded with exd4, and after Qxd4 Nc6, Zavanelli surprised his opponent with Bc4, the Max Lange Attack. This is a sharp and aggressive variation that leads to complex positions and sacrifices. Palciauskas accepted the challenge and played Nf6, the main line of defense.

Zavanelli won the game with a stunning checkmate, after sacrificing his rook and bishop to create a powerful passed pawn. He showed great skill and creativity in exploiting the weaknesses of black's position and finding the best moves in every situation. Palciauskas praised his opponent's performance and admitted his mistakes in the analysis. He also revealed that he had a cold during the game, which might have affected his concentration.
